# yahoo-contact-delete

This script was used to delete multiple contacts from yahoo mail client. It is using selectors from DOM and is simulating the user click and delete process. 

Step 1: Open the mail account on desktop.
Step 2: Click on the contact icon and show all the contacts in a list. 
Step 3: Open chrome debugger (or any debugger) and copy and paste the delete.js code in the console tab.
Step 4: Change the number of delete contacts and run.

You might get some errors if the script is too quick, you can slow the process by increasing the timeouts. Keepn in mind that the processes need to be sequential.
